       ffuusseerr  displays  the  PIDs of processes using the specified files or file systems.  In the default display
       mode, each file name is followed by a letter denoting the type of access:

              cc      current directory.
              ee      executable being run.
              ff      open file.  ff is omitted in default display mode.
              FF      open file for writing.  FF is omitted in default display mode.
              rr      root directory.
              mm      mmap'ed file or shared library.
              ..      Placeholder, omitted in default display mode.

       ffuusseerr returns a non-zero return code if none of the specified files is accessed or in case of a fatal  er‐
       ror.  If at least one access has been found, ffuusseerr returns zero.

       In  order  to look up processes using TCP and UDP sockets, the corresponding name space has to be selected
       with the --nn option. By default ffuusseerr will look in both IPv6 and IPv4 sockets.  To change the  default  be‐
       havior,  use  the --44 and --66 options.  The socket(s) can be specified by the local and remote port, and the
       remote address.  All fields are optional, but commas in front of missing fields must be present:

       [_l_c_l___p_o_r_t][,[_r_m_t___h_o_s_t][,[_r_m_t___p_o_r_t]]]

       Either symbolic or numeric values can be used for IP addresses and port numbers.

       ffuusseerr outputs only the PIDs to stdout, everything else is sent to stderr.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa, ----aallll
              Show all files specified on the command line.  By default, only files that are accessed by at least
              one process are shown.

       --cc     Same as --mm option, used for POSIX compatibility.

       --ff     Silently ignored, used for POSIX compatibility.

       --kk, ----kkiillll
              Kill processes accessing the file.  Unless changed with --_S_I_G_N_A_L, SIGKILL is sent.  An ffuusseerr process
              never kills itself, but may kill other ffuusseerr processes.  The effective user ID of the process  exe‐
              cuting ffuusseerr is set to its real user ID before attempting to kill.

       --ii, ----iinntteerraaccttiivvee
              Ask  the  user for confirmation before killing a process.  This option is silently ignored if --kk is
              not present too.

       --II, ----iinnooddee
              For the name space ffiillee let all comparisons be based on the inodes of  the  specified  file(s)  and
              never on the file names even on network based file systems.

       --ll, ----lliisstt--ssiiggnnaallss
              List all known signal names.

       --mm _N_A_M_E, ----mmoouunntt _N_A_M_E
              _N_A_M_E  specifies  a  file on a mounted file system or a block device that is mounted.  All processes
              accessing files on that file system are listed.  If a directory is specified, it  is  automatically
              changed to _N_A_M_E/ to use any file system that might be mounted on that directory.

       --MM, ----iissmmoouunnttppooiinntt
              Request  will  be  fulfilled  only if _N_A_M_E specifies a mountpoint.  This is an invaluable seat belt
              which prevents you from killing the machine if _N_A_M_E happens to not be a filesystem.

       --ww     Kill only processes which have write access.  This option is silently ignored if --kk is not  present
              too.

       --nn _N_A_M_E_S_P_A_C_E, ----nnaammeessppaaccee _N_A_M_E_S_P_A_C_E
              Select  a  different  name  space.   The name spaces ffiillee (file names, the default), uuddpp (local UDP
              ports), and ttccpp (local TCP ports) are supported.  For ports, either the port number or the symbolic
              name  can  be specified.  If there is no ambiguity, the shortcut notation _n_a_m_e//_s_p_a_c_e (e.g., _8_0//_t_c_p)
              can be used.

       --ss, ----ssiilleenntt
              Silent operation.  --uu and --vv are ignored in this mode.  --aa must not be used with --ss.

       --_S_I_G_N_A_L
              Use the specified signal instead of SIGKILL when killing processes.  Signals can be  specified  ei‐
              ther  by  name (e.g., --HHUUPP) or by number (e.g., --11).  This option is silently ignored if the --kk op‐
              tion is not used.

       --uu, ----uusseerr
              Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.

       --vv, ----vveerrbboossee
              Verbose mode.  Processes are shown in a ppss-like style.  The fields PID, USER and COMMAND are  simi‐
              lar  to  ppss.   ACCESS  shows how the process accesses the file.  Verbose mode will also show when a
              particular file is being accessed as a mount point, knfs export or swap file.  In this case  kkeerrnneell
              is shown instead of the PID.

       --VV, ----vveerrssiioonn
              Display version information.

       --44, ----iippvv44
              Search  only for IPv4 sockets.  This option must not be used with the --66 option and only has an ef‐
              fect with the tcp and udp namespaces.

       --66, ----iippvv66
              Search only for IPv6 sockets.  This option must not be used with the --44 option and only has an  ef‐
              fect with the tcp and udp namespaces.

       --      Reset all options and set the signal back to SIGKILL.

       /proc  location of the proc file system

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       ffuusseerr --kkmm //hhoommee
              kills all processes accessing the file system /home in any way.

       iiff ffuusseerr --ss //ddeevv//ttttyySS11;; tthheenn ::;; eellssee _c_o_m_m_a_n_d;; ffii
              invokes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d if no other process is using /dev/ttyS1.

       ffuusseerr tteellnneett//ttccpp
              shows all processes at the (local) TELNET port.

RREESSTTRRIICCTTIIOONNSS
       Processes accessing the same file or file system several times in the same way are only shown once.

       If the same object is specified several times on the command line, some of those entries may be ignored.

       ffuusseerr  may only be able to gather partial information unless run with privileges.  As a consequence, files
       opened by processes belonging to other users may not be listed and executables may be classified as mapped
       only.

       ffuusseerr  cannot report on any processes that it doesn't have permission to look at the file descriptor table
       for.  The most common time this problem occurs is when looking for TCP or UDP sockets when  running  ffuusseerr
       as a non-root user.  In this case ffuusseerr will report no access.

       Installing ffuusseerr SUID root will avoid problems associated with partial information, but may be undesirable
       for security and privacy reasons.

       uuddpp and ttccpp name spaces, and UNIX domain sockets can't be searched with kernels older than 1.3.78.

       Accesses by the kernel are only shown with the --vv option.

       The --kk option only works on processes.  If the user is the kernel, ffuusseerr will print an advice, but take no
       action beyond that.

BBUUGGSS
       ffuusseerr  --mm  //ddeevv//ssggXX will show (or kill with the --kk flag) all processes, even if you don't have that device
       configured.  There may be other devices it does this for too.

       The mount --mm option will match any file within the same device as the specified file, use the --MM option as
       well if you mean to specify only the mount point.
